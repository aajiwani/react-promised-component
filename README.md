> I need a component when a promise succeeds, fails or during loading
> This package would come handy in that case.

##### Surpise: It has a yeoman generator as well!

## Installation

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)). We assume, you have a running React project as well.

```bash
npm install react-promised-component --save
```

Leave the rest for Yeoman to take care of

```bash
yo react-promised-component
```

If you want to have a look at generator
[generator-react-promised-component](https://github.com/aajiwani/generator-react-promised-component)

## Usage

```js
<PromisedComponent
    promise_prop={this.promiseGenerator.bind(this)}
    promise_prop_params={this.promiseParams.bind(this)}
    promise_prop_check_result_errors={this.checkErrorsInResult.bind(this)}
  />

// promise_prop: the method that generates a new promise
// promise_prop_params: the method that can generate parameters and magically supply it to promise creator
// promise_prop_check_result_errors: the method to check for value, if for some reason value may contain any errors!
```

## Surprise

You can leverage a retry on promise if you want to without any fuss. Please refer to this repo for more details.
